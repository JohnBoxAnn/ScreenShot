# ScreenShot

<b>INTRODUCTION: A light Program with C++ & Windows 10 API to get & save screen shot in Windows 10.</b>

<b>NOTICE: </b>THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS 10, CAUSE IT USES UNDOCUMENTED FUNCTIONS OF WINDOWS 10!

<b>NOTICE: </b>THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FINISHED!

It's my first code in Github, hope you will like it. If there were something wrong with the code, I would be very sorry & sad about that. Please leave me a message when you find bugs & better ways to realize the function.

<b>Useage by now: </b>run <b><i>ScreenShot.exe</i></b>. On the first time you run it, it will create <b><i>config.ini</i></b> and folder <b><i>screenshot</i></b>, and then after two dialogs, you need to select a rectangle area you want to capture by <b>Click and Drag</b>. Then the picture will be saved into folder <b><i>screenshot</i></b>. If you are not the first time to run it, you can set two kinds of mode to use it, use mouse to select the rectangle area and automatically capture a fixed area. You can change the modes in <b><i>config.ini</i></b>.
